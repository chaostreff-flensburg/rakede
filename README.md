# rakede

> intergalactic organization communication

## Getting Started

To run rakede you need an instance of RethinkDB and a somewhat up to date version of node. On macOS with Homebrew or your favorite linux-distro with linuxbrew run:

    brew install rethinkdb
    rethinkdb

You can find documentation on installing RethinkDB with your package manager of choice [in the RethinkDB documentation](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/). It runs on pretty much everything.  
After that clone the repo, `cd` into it and run:

    npm install
    npm start

The rakede now fires up its engines and reloads automatically on file changes. You can find your instance running on [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/).
