- [ ] parse markdown articles only once on change and not on every request
  - parse front-matter meta data with grey-matter
  - syntax highlight on html creation
  - generate html files into cache-directory and respond with those
  - or generate html into a neDB, gives nice interface to work with
- [ ] create logic for homepage
- [ ] categories under /cat/, generated through db entries & optional additional styling in content folder
- [ ] article editor
  - simplemde markdown editor
  - versioning via simple-git
